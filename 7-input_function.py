print("Tell me anything...")

# Note:

#     the input() function is invoked with one argument - it's a string containing a message;
#     the message will be displayed on the console before the user is given an opportunity to enter anything;
#     input() will then do its job.

# This variant of the input() invocation simplifies the code and makes it clearer.
