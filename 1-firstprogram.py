print("hisssssss.....")


# try
# print("hisssssss.....

# also try
# prin("hissssss.....")

# both will give differerent error messages





# The editor window will not provide any useful information regarding the error, but the console windows might.

# The message (in red) shows (in the subsequent lines):

#     the traceback (which is the path that the code traverses through different parts of the program - you can ignore it for now, as it is empty in such a simple code);
#     the location of the error (the name of the file containing the error, line number and module name); note: the number may be misleading, as Python usually shows the place where it first notices the effects of the error, not necessarily the error itself;
#     the content of the erroneous line; note: IDLE’s editor window doesn’t show line numbers, but it displays the current cursor location at the bottom-right corner; use it to locate the erroneous line in a long source code;
#     the name of the error and a short explanation.
